# Single-File Dependency Management in Python Script Using UV

Make sure you already have [uv installed](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/).
 
I don’t have Numpy installed globally, so we’ll use that in our example script. Create a file named **numpy_version.py** with the following contents:

```python
import numpy as np

def show_numpy_version():
    print(np.__version__)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    show_numpy_version()
```

If we try to run it as-is (`python3 numpy_version.py`) we see this:

```txt
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "numpy_version.py", line 1, in <module>
    import numpy as np
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'numpy'
```

We can use uv to add inline metadata declaring the dependencies:

```bash
uv add --script numpy_version.py numpy
```

The script will be updated to look like this:

```python
# /// script
# requires-python = ">=3.12"
# dependencies = [
#     "numpy",
# ]
# ///
import numpy as np

def show_numpy_version():
    print(np.__version__)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    show_numpy_version()
```

Then, we use uv to run it:

```bash
uv run numpy_version.py
```

And we get this output:

```txt
Reading inline script metadata from `numpy_version.py`
2.2.1
```

We can make our script directly runnable by adding a shebang line at the top of the file:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env -S uv run -q -s
```

…and making the script executable:

```bash
chmod u+x numpy_version.py
```

> **The -S argument to env is required in order for the run argument to be handled correctly.**

Now we can run the script as `./numpy_version.py`.

When we run the script like this, uv automatically manages the dependencies in an isolated environment. We can test this by trying to run the updated script directly with Python again:

```bash
python3 numpy_version.py
```

We get this, indicating that in a global context Numpy is still not installed:

```txt
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "numpy_version.py", line 10, in <module>
    import numpy as np
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'numpy'
```

Our end result is a nice, clean, directly runnable, isolated script whose only execution requirement is that uv be installed.

The portability that this provides is really nice. I installed uv on a [Le Potato](https://libre.computer/products/aml-s905x-cc/) and I was able to immediately run my script on the device with no changes. UV even automatically installed a CPython version to meet the Python version requirement. (The inline metadata specifies a Python version >= 3.12, but the global Python interpreter on the SBC is 3.11)
