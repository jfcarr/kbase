# Using UV To Manage a ESP8266 MicroPython Project

# Background

> The ESP8266 is a low-cost Wi-Fi microcontroller, with built-in TCP/IP networking software, and microcontroller capability, produced by Espressif Systems in Shanghai, China.
>
> The chip was popularized in the English-speaking maker community in August 2014 via the ESP-01 module, made by a third-party manufacturer Ai-Thinker. This small module allows microcontrollers to connect to a Wi-Fi network and make simple TCP/IP connections using Hayes-style commands. However, at first, there was almost no English-language documentation on the chip and the commands it accepted. The very low price and the fact that there were very few external components on the module, which suggested that it could eventually be very inexpensive in volume, attracted many hackers to explore the module, the chip, and the software on it, as well as to translate the Chinese documentation.

I’m using the [ESP32 Basic Starter Kit](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0BVZBTP8V), which contains an ESP8266 module with the following specifications:

* Model : ESP8266MOD
* Vendor : AI-THINKER
* ISM : 2.4 GHz
* PA : +25 dBm
* Wireless : 802.11b/g/n

# Project Setup

Adapted from here: <https://docs.micropython.org/en/latest/esp8266/tutorial/intro.html>

Make sure your ESP8266 is connected.

## Initialize Project, Install ESP Tools

Create a project directory and cd into it:

```bash
mkdir esp_test
 
cd esp_test
```

Initialize the project:

```bash
uv init
```

The [esptool utility](https://pypi.org/project/esptool/) is used to communicate with the ROM bootloader in Expressif chips. Add the esptool package:

```bash
uv add esptool
```

Show available commands:

```bash
uv tool run --from esptool esptool.py
```

Commands:

|Command Name | Description|
|------------ | -----------|
| load_ram | Download an image to RAM and execute |
| dump_mem | Dump arbitrary memory to disk |
| read_mem | Read arbitrary memory location |
| write_mem | Read-modify-write to arbitrary memory location |
| write_flash | Write a binary blob to flash |
| run | Run application code in flash |
| image_info | Dump headers from a binary file (bootloader or application) |
| make_image | Create an application image from binary files |
| elf2image | Create an application image from ELF file |
| read_mac | Read MAC address from OTP ROM |
| chip_id | Read Chip ID from OTP ROM |
| flash_id | Read SPI flash manufacturer and device ID |
| read_flash_status | Read SPI flash status register |
| write_flash_status | Write SPI flash status register |
| read_flash | Read SPI flash content |
| verify_flash | Verify a binary blob against flash |
| erase_flash | Perform Chip Erase on SPI flash |
| erase_region | Erase a region of the flash |
| read_flash_sfdp | Read SPI flash SFDP (Serial Flash Discoverable Parameters) |
| merge_bin | Merge multiple raw binary files into a single file for later flashing |
| get_security_info | Get some security-related data |
| version | Print esptool version |

Get chip information:

```bash
uv tool run --from esptool esptool.py chip_id
```

Output:

## Install MicroPython

> MicroPython is a software implementation of a programming language largely compatible with Python 3, written in C, that is optimized to run on a microcontroller.
>
> MicroPython consists of a Python compiler to bytecode and a runtime interpreter of that bytecode. The user is presented with an interactive prompt (the REPL) to execute supported commands immediately. Included are a selection of core Python libraries; MicroPython includes modules which give the programmer access to low-level hardware.

> from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MicroPython)

Erase flash:

```bash
uv tool run --from esptool esptool.py erase_flash
```

Get the MicroPython firmware:

```bash
wget https://micropython.org/resources/firmware/ESP8266_GENERIC-20241129-v1.24.1.bin
```

Flash the firmware to the ESP8266:

```bash
uv tool run --from esptool esptool.py --baud 460800 write_flash --flash_size=detect 0 ESP8266_GENERIC-20241129-v1.24.1.bin
```

## Test MicroPython

Install picocom (if needed) and connect to REPL:

```bash
sudo apt install picocom

picocom /dev/ttyUSB0 -b115200
```

Test the REPL:

```txt
>>> print('hello esp8266!')

hello esp8266!
```

## Upload and Run a Python Script

Adapted from here: <https://problemsolvingwithpython.com/12-MicroPython/12.06-Uploading-Code/>

> MicroPython Tool (ampy) is a utility to interact with a CircuitPython or MicroPython board over a serial connection.
>
> Ampy is meant to be a simple command line tool to manipulate files and run code on a CircuitPython or MicroPython board over its serial connection. With ampy you can send files from your computer to the board’s file system, download files from a board to your computer, and even send a Python script to a board to be executed.
>
> from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/adafruit-ampy/)

Install ampy:

```bash
uv add adafruit-ampy
```

Upload a script, then list the file contents of the microcontroller to confirm it’s there:

```bash
uv tool run --from adafruit-ampy ampy -p /dev/ttyUSB0 put hello.py

uv tool run --from adafruit-ampy ampy -p /dev/ttyUSB0 ls
```

Output:

```txt
/boot.py
/hello.py
```

Run the uploaded script:

```bash
uv tool run --from adafruit-ampy ampy -p /dev/ttyUSB0 run hello.py
```

Output:

```txt
Hello from esp-test!
```
